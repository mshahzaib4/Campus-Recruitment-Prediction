### Description for Web Application: Salary Prediction System  

Welcome to the **Salary Prediction System**, a comprehensive web application built using Flask, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a Machine Learning pipeline tailored for undergraduate-level understanding.  

In this application, we aim to predict the **salary of employees** based on their features by leveraging powerful regression models. Hereâ€™s an overview of the workflow integrated into the system:  

#### **Key Features**  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Gain insights into the dataset with interactive visualizations and descriptive statistics. Understand trends, correlations, and outliers.  

2. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**  
   Handle missing values, format datasets, and standardize features to ensure optimal model performance.  

3. **Data Visualization:**  
   Intuitive graphs and charts are created using advanced visualization libraries to provide an in-depth look at the dataset's structure and key metrics.  

4. **Model Training and Prediction:**  
   Implement regression models to train and predict employee salaries. Models integrated into the application include:  
   - **Linear Regression**  
   - **Lasso**  
   - **Ridge**  
   - **Decision Tree Regressor**  
   - **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**  
   - **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  

5. **Web Interface:**  
   The user-friendly interface allows users to:  
   - Upload datasets.  
   - Visualize data through pre-built graphs and charts.  
   - Train regression models with a single click.  
   - Predict salaries based on input features.  

#### **Technology Stack**  
- **Backend:** Flask for managing the server-side logic.  
- **Frontend:** HTML and CSS for creating a responsive and visually appealing interface.  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn and related Python libraries for building, training, and evaluating models.
